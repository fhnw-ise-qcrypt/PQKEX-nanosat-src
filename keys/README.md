#### 1. as in the sub directories:

- `**A.key` = "Alice" = Satellite
- `**B.key` = "Bob" = Ground Station

#### 2. as executed practically:

- `**A.key` = my own key
- `**B.key` = other party's key

So if you would want to verify the generation of the `COMMON.key` you would first have to rename the files to match nomenclature (2.)

### Public Key Exchange

Renaming files according to nomenclature (2.)

same for both variations
- 游니 `gnd/PKA.key` --> 游띯 `sat/PKB.key`
- 游니 `gnd/PKB.key` <-- 游띯 `sat/PKA.key`


### `./20211014_planA/` (satellite initiates key exchange)

- 游띯 satellite executes: `kex_ake_initA()`
- 游니 `gnd/ake_senda.txt` <-- 游띯 `sat/ake_senda.txt`
- 游니 ground station executes: `kex_ake_sharedB()`
- 游니 `gnd/ake_sendb.txt` --> 游띯 `sat/ake_sendb.txt`
- 游띯 satellite executes: `kex_ake_sharedA()`

```bash
diff 20211014_planA/gnd/COMMON.key 20211014_planA/sat/COMMON.key
```

### `./20211014_planB/` (ground station initiates key exchange)

- 游니 ground station executes: `kex_ake_initA()`
- 游니 `gnd/ake_senda.txt` --> 游띯 `sat/ake_senda.txt`
- 游띯 satellite executes: `kex_ake_sharedB()`
- 游니 `gnd/ake_sendb.txt` <-- 游띯 `sat/ake_sendb.txt`
- 游니 ground station executes: `kex_ake_sharedA()`

```bash
diff 20211014_planB/gnd/COMMON.key 20211014_planB/sat/COMMON.key
```
